# Chrome Extension Iframe (template)

## What is this?
While I was trying Google Chrome extension API, I noticed that some people including me wonder how to make a page for their Chrome extension. Usually, iFrame is one of the options to achieve that goal, but advice and codes were not that straightforward to me. The goal of this source code is to provide better sense for anyone interested in Chrome extension with iFrame.
