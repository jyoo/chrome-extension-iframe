# Chrome Extension Iframe (template)

## What is this?
This repo contains files for a Chome Extension. I tried to build an extension that shows a dedicated section or page, and knew that iFrame might be an option.

In fact, to show just a page, it was a bit hard for me as I needed to google several times, but could achieve it in the end. Using this repo, you would be able to save time to develop an awesome extension!

### Key Point
- You can download it and try it out on Google Chrome right away.
- For UI, Bootstrap package is included
- State, data storage and more will come later :)
